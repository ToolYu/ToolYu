## Hi, I'm Qianyu 👋

I'm a Data Science graduate student at NYU with a background in mathematics and physics.

I’m currently working as a Research Assistant at NYU, where I explore data-driven methods for academic research — from building scraping pipelines and analyzing social content to experimenting with multi-agent systems and LLM-based workflows.

Previously, I worked at JD.com, focusing on applied machine learning for user growth and decision systems. That experience deepened my interest in building models that are not just accurate, but actually useful in real production settings.

More broadly, I’m interested in practical machine learning — especially where modeling, experimentation, and product thinking intersect. I enjoy turning messy real-world data into something structured, testable, and meaningful.

### Tools I use often
Python · PyTorch · XGBoost · SQL · Spark · LLM frameworks

Outside of work, I like photography and sports, and I’m always curious about how complex systems — financial, technical, or social — actually work under the hood.
